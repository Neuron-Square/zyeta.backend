# Architecture Overview

Zyeta follows a modular, service-oriented architecture designed for scalability and maintainability. This page provides an overview of the system's core components and how they interact.

## System Architecture

The Zyeta backend is built using FastAPI and follows modern API design principles. The architecture is organized into several key components:

## Core Components

### Application Layer

- **FastAPI Application**: The main entry point that handles HTTP requests and responses
- **Dependency Injection**: A system for providing dependencies to API endpoints
- **Middleware**: Components that process requests/responses globally

### Service Layer

- **Business Logic**: Implements the core application functionality
- **Service Classes**: Encapsulate domain-specific operations
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and tools used across services

### Data Layer

- **Models**: SQLAlchemy ORM models representing database entities
- **Schemas**: Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database connection and session management
- **Migrations**: Alembic-managed database schema migrations

## Directory Structure

Zyeta follows a structured directory organization:

```

## Request Lifecycle

When an HTTP request reaches the Zyeta API, it goes through the following stages:

1. **Middleware Processing**: The request passes through global middleware for authentication, logging, etc.
2. **Route Matching**: FastAPI matches the URL path to the appropriate route handler
3. **Parameter Validation**: Request data is validated against Pydantic schemas
4. **Dependency Resolution**: FastAPI resolves and injects dependencies
5. **Handler Execution**: The route handler executes business logic, often delegating to services
6. **Response Generation**: The handler returns data, which FastAPI converts to JSON
7. **Middleware Post-Processing**: The response passes through middleware again
8. **Client Delivery**: The final response is sent to the client

## Design Principles

Zyeta's architecture is built around these core principles:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between components
- **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling between services
- **Schema Validation**: Strong typing and validation of all data
- **Async First**: Asynchronous request handling for improved performance
- **Database Abstraction**: Clean separation between business logic and data access

## Data Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Client Request">
    A client sends an HTTP request to an API endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="API Controller">
    FastAPI routes the request to the appropriate controller in the servers directory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Service Layer">
    Controllers delegate to service classes that implement business logic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Access">
    Services interact with the database through SQLAlchemy ORM models.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Response">
    Data flows back through the service and controller, returning a response to the client.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This architecture allows for clean separation of concerns while maintaining flexibility and scalability.
