# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you set up and run Zyeta on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.9 or later
- PostgreSQL 16 (recommended)
- Docker (optional, for containerized setup)

## Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zyeta-io/zyeta.backend.git
cd zyeta.backend
```

2. Create a Python virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Create your environment file by copying the example file
```bash
cp .env.local .env
```

4. Configure the following environment variables in the `.env` file:
```
APP_NAME=zyeta-backend
DATABASE_URL=<DATABASE URL>
ENVIRONMENT=development
FRONTEND_URL=<FRONTEND URL>
JWT_SECRET=<JWT SECRET>
MASTER_API_KEY=<MASTER API KEY>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI API KEY>
RESEND_API_KEY=<RESEND API KEY>
```

## Database Setup

You can set up the database either locally or using Docker.

### Local PostgreSQL Setup

1. Install PostgreSQL by following the [official installation guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
2. Create a database for Zyeta
3. Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://<user>:<password>@<host>:5432/<db-name>
```

<Tip>
If your database password contains special characters like '@', remember to URL-encode them. For example, use '%40' instead of '@'.
</Tip>

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

1. Ensure Docker is installed on your system
2. Run the following command from the project root:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will start PostgreSQL and pgAdmin containers as defined in the `compose.yml` file.

## Application Setup

1. Install dependencies using Poetry:
```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

2. Set up database migrations:
```bash
cp alembic.copy.ini alembic.ini
```

3. Edit `alembic.ini` and set the `sqlalchemy.url` to match your database URL

4. Apply database migrations:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

5. Start the application:
```bash
# Using uvicorn
uvicorn src.app:app --reload

# OR using fastapi
fastapi dev src/app.py
```

6. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) to access the Swagger documentation
