# Authentication

Zyeta uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authenticating API requests. This guide covers how authentication works and how to implement it in your applications.

## Authentication Methods

Zyeta supports two primary authentication methods:

1. **JWT Token Authentication**: For user-based access
2. **API Key Authentication**: For service-to-service communication

## JWT Authentication

JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

### How It Works

1. A user provides valid credentials (username/password)
2. The server validates credentials and returns a JWT token
3. The client includes this token in subsequent requests
4. The server validates the token for each request

### Token Structure

A JWT token consists of three parts separated by dots:
- **Header**: Contains token type and algorithm
- **Payload**: Contains claims (user information)
- **Signature**: Verifies the token hasn't been altered

### Implementation

To authenticate with JWT:

```python
import requests

# 1. Get a token
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.zyeta.io/auth/login",
    json={"email": "user@example.com", "password": "your_password"}
)
token = response.json()["access_token"]

# 2. Use the token in requests
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
response = requests.get("https://api.zyeta.io/protected-resource", headers=headers)
```

### Token Expiration

JWT tokens have an expiration time (typically 24 hours). After expiration, you'll need to obtain a new token.

## API Key Authentication

For service-to-service communication or automated scripts, you can use API key authentication.

### How It Works

1. An API key is generated in the Zyeta dashboard
2. The key is included in the request header
3. The server validates the API key

### Implementation

To authenticate with an API key:

```python
import requests

headers = {"X-API-Key": "your_api_key"}
response = requests.get("https://api.zyeta.io/protected-resource", headers=headers)
```

## Master API Key

For administrative purposes, a master API key can be configured using the `MASTER_API_KEY` environment variable. This key has full access to all API endpoints.

<Warning>
The master API key should be kept secure and only used for administrative tasks or development purposes.
</Warning>

## Security Best Practices

When implementing authentication with Zyeta:

1. **Store tokens securely**: Never store tokens in local storage or cookies without proper security measures
2. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for API requests
3. **Minimal scope**: Use the least privileged access possible
4. **Token rotation**: Implement token rotation for long-lived applications
5. **Validate on server**: Always validate tokens on the server side

## Troubleshooting

Common authentication issues:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Token">
    Ensure the token is valid and hasn't expired. Check that you're using the correct format: `Bearer <token>`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Token Expired">
    JWT tokens expire after their set lifetime. Request a new token by authenticating again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invalid API Key">
    Verify the API key is correct and active in the Zyeta dashboard.
  </Accordion>
